<h2>LITTLE JACK RABBIT AND<br />
BUNTY BUN</h2>

<h3>JACK RABBIT TELLS ABOUT HIS SCHOOL-DAYS,
AND WHY HE HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
BEST TO LIVE ALONE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Little Lady has been poring over a
first reader, because she has started to
school now, and there are lessons almost
every evening. Then by and by she closes
the book and comes over to where the
Story Teller is looking into the big open
fire.</div>

<p>The Little Lady looks into the fire, too,
and thinks. Then pretty soon she climbs
into the Story Teller's lap and leans back,
and looks into the fire and thinks some
more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the Hollow Tree people ever go to
school?" she says. "I s'pose they did,
though, or they wouldn't know how to read
and write, and send invitations and
things."</p>

<p>The Story Teller knocks the ashes out of his
pipe and lays it on the little stand beside
him.</p>

<p>"Why, yes indeed, they went to school,"
he says. "Didn't I ever tell you about
that?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have," says the Little
Lady, "because I never thought about its
happening, myself, until just now."</p>

<p>"Well, then," says the Story Teller, "I'll
tell you something that Mr. Jack Rabbit
told about, one night in the Hollow Tree,
when he had been having supper with the
'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow,
and they were all sitting before the fire, just
as we are sitting now. It isn't really much
about school, but it shows that Jack Rabbit
went to one, and explains something else,
too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Crow had cooked all his best things
that evening, and everything had tasted
even better than usual. Mr. 'Possum said
he didn't really feel as if he could move from
his chair when supper was over, but that he
wanted to do the right thing, and would
watch the fire and poke it while the others
were clearing the table, so that it would be
nice and bright for them when they were
ready to enjoy it. So then the Crow and the
'Coon and Jack Rabbit flew about and did
up the work, while Mr. 'Possum put on a
fresh stick, then lit his pipe, and leaned back
and stretched out his feet, and said it surely
was nice to have a fine, cozy home like theirs,
and that he was always happy when he was
doing things for people who appreciated it,
like those present.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/z010.jpg" width="377" height="425" alt="MR. RABBIT SAID HE CERTAINLY DID APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO THE HOLLOW TREE" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. RABBIT SAID HE CERTAINLY DID APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO THE HOLLOW TREE</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Rabbit said he certainly did appreciate
being invited to the Hollow Tree, living, as
he did, alone, an old bachelor, with nobody
to share his home; and then pretty soon the
work was all done up, and Jack Rabbit and
the others drew up their chairs, too, and lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
their pipes, and for a while nobody said
anything, but just smoked and felt happy.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum was first to say something.
He leaned over and knocked the ashes out
of his pipe, then leaned back and crossed his
feet, and said he'd been thinking about Mr.
Rabbit's lonely life, and wondering why it
was that, with his fondness for society and
such a good home, he had stayed a bachelor
so long. Then the Crow and the 'Coon said
so, too, and asked Jack Rabbit why it was.</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit said it was quite a sad story,
and perhaps not very interesting, as it had
all happened so long ago, when he was quite
small.</p>

<p>"My folks lived then in the Heavy
Thickets, over beyond the Wide Grasslands,"
he said; "it was a very nice place, with a
good school, kept by a stiff-kneed rabbit
named Whack&mdash;J. Hickory Whack&mdash;which
seemed to fit him. I was the only child in
our family that year, and I suppose I was
spoiled. I remember my folks let me run and
play a good deal, instead of making me study
my lessons, so that Hickory Whack did not
like me much, though he was afraid to be as
severe as he was with most of the others, my
folks being quite well off and I an only child.
Of course, the other scholars didn't like that,
and I don't blame them now, though I
didn't care then whether they liked it or
not. I didn't care for anything, except to
go capering about the woods, gathering
flowers and trying to make up poetry, when
I should have been doing my examples. I
didn't like school or J. Hickory Whack, and
every morning I hated to start, until, one
day, a new family moved into our neighborhood.
They were named Bun, and one of
them was a little girl named Bunty&mdash;Bunty
Bun."</p>

<p>When Mr. Rabbit got that far in his story
he stopped a minute and sighed, and filled
his pipe again, and took out his handkerchief,
and said he guessed a little speck of ashes
had got into his eye. Then he said:</p>

<p>"The Buns lived close to us, and the
children went the same way to school as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
did. Bunty was little and fat, and was
generally behind, and I stayed behind with
her, after the first morning. She seemed a
very well-behaved little Miss Rabbit, and
was quite plump, as I say, and used to have
plump little books, which I used to carry for
her and think how nice it would be if I
could always go on carrying them and
helping Bunty Bun over the mud-holes and
ditches."</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit got another speck of ashes in
his eye, and had to wipe it several times and
blow his nose hard. Then he said:</p>

<p>"She wore a little red cape and a pretty
linsey dress, and her ears were quite slim and
silky, and used to stand straight up, except
when she was sad over anything. Then they
used to lop down quite flat; when I saw them
that way it made me sad, too. But when
she was pleased and happy, they set straight
up and she seemed to laugh all over.</p>

<p>"I forgot all about not liking school. I
used to watch until I saw the Bun children
coming, and then run out and get behind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with Bunty, and take her books, and wish
there was a good deal farther to go. When
it got to be spring and flowers began to bloom,
I would gather every one I saw for Bunty
Bun, and once I made up a poem for her. I
remember it still. It said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, Bunty Bun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The spring's begun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The violet's are in bloom.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, Bunty Bun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll pick you one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All full of sweet perfume.</span><br />
<br />
"The sun is bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our hearts are light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And we will skip and run.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Prick up your ears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And dry your tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dear bunny, Bunty Bun."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Mr. Rabbit said he didn't suppose it was
the best poetry, but that it had meant so
much to him then that he couldn't judge it
now, and, anyway, it was no matter any
more. The other children used to tease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
them a good deal, Mr. Rabbit said, but that
he and Bunty had not minded it so very
much, only, of course, he wouldn't have had
them see his poem for anything. The trouble
began when Bunty Bun decided to have a
flower-garden.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/z016.jpg" width="352" height="450" alt="&quot;FLOWERS THAT SHE WANTED ME TO DIG UP FOR HER&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;FLOWERS THAT SHE WANTED ME TO DIG UP FOR HER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"She used to see new flowers along the
way to and from school that she wanted me
to dig up for her so she could set them out
in her garden. I liked to do it better than
anything, too, only not <i>going</i> to school,
because the ground was pretty soft and
sticky, and it made my hands so dirty, and
Hickory Whack was particular about the
children having clean hands. I used to hide
the flower plants under the corner of the
school-house every morning, and hurry in and
wash my hands before school took up, and
the others used to watch me and giggle, for
they knew what all that dirt came from.
Our school was just one room, and there were
rows of nails by the door to hang our things
on, and there was a bench with the washbasin
and the water-pail on it, the basin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the pail side by side. It was a misfortune
for me that they were put so close together
that way. But never mind&mdash;it is a long
time ago.</p>

<p>"One morning in April when it was quite
chilly Bunty Bun saw several pretty plants
on the way to school that she wanted me to
dig up for her, root and all, for her garden.
I said it would be better to get them on the
way home that night, but Bunty said some
one might come along and take them and
that she wouldn't lose those nice plants for
anything. So I got down on my knees and
dug and dug with my hands in the cold,
sticky dirt, until I got the roots all up for
her, and my hands were quite numb and a
sight to look at. Then we hurried on to
school, for it was getting late.</p>

<p>"When we got to the door I pushed the
flower plants under the edge of the house,
and we went in, Bunty ahead of me. School
had just taken up, and all the scholars were
in their seats except us. Bunty Bun went
over to the girls' side to hang up her things,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and I stuck my hat on a nail on our side, and
stepped as quick as I could to the bench
where the water was, to wash my hands.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/z020.jpg" width="344" height="425" alt="&quot;I HAD MADE A MISS-DIP, AND EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT ME&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I HAD MADE A MISS-DIP, AND EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT ME&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"There was some water in the basin, and
I was just about to dip my hands in when I
looked over toward Bunty Bun and saw her
little ears all lopped down flat, for the other
little girl rabbits were giggling at her for
coming in with me and being late. The boy
rabbits were giggling at me, too, which I did
not mind so much. But I forgot all about
the basin, for a minute, looking at Bunty
Bun's ears, and when I started to wash my
hands I kept looking at Bunty, and in that
way made an awful mistake; for just when
the water was feeling so good to my poor
chilled hands, and I was waving them about
in it, all the time looking at Bunty's droopy
ears, somebody suddenly called out, 'Oh,
teacher, Jacky Rabbit's washing his hands
in the water-pail! Jacky Rabbit's washing
his hands in the water-pail, teacher!'</p>

<p>"And sure enough, I was! Looking at
Bunty Bun and pitying her, I had made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
miss-dip, and everybody was looking at me;
and J. Hickory Whack said, in the most awful
voice, 'Jack Rabbit, you come here, at
once!'"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/z022.jpg" width="369" height="425" alt="MR. RABBIT SAID HE COULD HARDLY GET TO HICKORY WHACK&#39;S DESK" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. RABBIT SAID HE COULD HARDLY GET TO HICKORY WHACK&#39;S DESK</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Rabbit said he could hardly get to
Hickory Whack's desk, he was so weak in
the knees, and when Mr. Whack had asked
him what he had meant by such actions he
had been almost too feeble to speak.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of a word," he said,
"for, of course, the only thing I could say
was that I had been looking at Bunty Bun's
little droopy ears, and that would have made
everybody laugh, and been much worse.
Then the teacher said he didn't see how he
was going to keep himself from whipping
me soundly, he felt so much that way, and
he said it in such an awful tone that all the
others were pretty scared, too, and quite
still, all of them but just one&mdash;one scholar
on the girls' side, who giggled right out loud&mdash;and
I know you will hardly believe it when
I tell you that it was Bunty Bun! I was sure
I knew her laugh, but I couldn't believe it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and, scared as I was, I turned to look, and
there she sat, looking really amused, her
slim little ears sticking straight up as they
always did when she enjoyed anything."</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit rose and walked across the
room and back, and sat down again, quite
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Think of it, after all I had done for her!
I saw at once that there would be no pleasure
in carrying her books and helping her over
the mud-puddles in the way I had planned.
And just then Hickory Whack grabbed a
stick and reached for me. But he didn't
reach quite far enough, for I was always
rather spry, and I was half-way to the door
with one spring, and out of it and on the way
home, the next. Of course he couldn't
catch me, with his stiff leg, and he didn't
try. When I got home I told my folks that
I didn't feel well, and needed a change of
scene. So they said I could visit some
relatives in the Big Deep Woods&mdash;an old
aunt and uncle, and I set out on the trip
within less than five minutes, for I was tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the Thickets. My aunt and uncle were
so glad to see me that I stayed with them,
and when they died they left me their
property. So I've always stayed over this
way, and live in it still. Sometimes I go
over to the Heavy Thickets, and once I saw
Bunty Bun. She is married, and shows her
age. She used to be fat and pretty and
silly. Now she is just fat and silly, though
I don't suppose she can help those things.
Still, I had a narrow escape, and I've never
thought of doing garden work since then for
anybody but myself and my good friends,
like those of the Hollow Tree."</p>

<h2>COUSIN REDFIELD AND THE<br />
MOLASSES</h2>

<h3>COUSIN REDFIELD BEAR MISBEHAVES AND IS
CURED OF HIS TASTE FOR MOLASSES</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Little Lady has been to the circus
during the afternoon and has come home
full of it. There were ever so many things
to see there, but nicest of all were some little
bears&mdash;three of them&mdash;who rolled over one
another in their cage and seemed to be
having the best time in the world. She tells
the Story Teller all about them after supper;
then she says:</div>

<p>"Do you know any story about little
bears? Did the Bear family in the Big
Deep Woods ever come visiting to the
Hollow Tree?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Story Teller thinks.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "or rather, Mr. Bear
came once alone, but that is another story.
I know one story, though, about a little bear,
a story that Mr. Crow told one night when
he had been over to spend the afternoon with
Mr. Bear, they bring very good friends."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bear told me this afternoon," Mr.
Crow said, "about something that happened
in his uncle's family some years ago. His
uncle's name was Brownwood&mdash;Brownwood
Bear&mdash;and he had a little boy named Redfield,
but they called him Reddie, for short.
Uncle Brownwood lost his wife one night
when she went over to get one of Mr. Man's
pigs, and he and little Redfield used to live
together in a nice cave over near the Wide
Blue Water, not far from the place where
Mr. Turtle lives now. Uncle Brownwood
used to be gone a good deal to get food and
whatever they needed, and Reddie would
stay at home or sleep in the cave, or play
outside and roll and tumble about in the sun
and have a very good time. He had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
number of playthings, too, and plenty of
nice things to eat, and every morning, before
Uncle Brownwood Bear started out, he would
put out enough to last Cousin Redfield all
day&mdash;some ripe berries, and apples, with
doughnuts, and such things, and always
some bread and butter and molasses to
finish up on.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/z030.jpg" width="367" height="450" alt="&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T EAT THE BREAD AT ALL BUT JUST ATE UP THE MOLASSES&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T EAT THE BREAD AT ALL BUT JUST ATE UP THE MOLASSES&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Little Reddie Bear liked all these things
very much, but best of all he liked the
molasses. Not bread and molasses, but
just molasses; and he used to beg Uncle
Brownwood to give him a whole saucer of
molasses to dip his bread in; but once when
his father did that he didn't eat the bread
at all, but just ate up the molasses, and was
sick that night, though he said it wasn't
the molasses that did it, but carrying in some
wood and washing the dishes, which he had
to do every evening.</p>

<p>"But Uncle Brownwood didn't give Cousin
Redfield any more molasses in a saucer; he
spread his bread for him every morning, and
set the molasses-jug on a high shelf, out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
reach, and Reddie used to stand and look
at it, when his father was gone, and wander
how long it would be before he would be
tall enough to get it down and enjoy himself
with the contents.</p>

<p>"One day when Cousin Redfield was
looking at the jug he had an idea. Just
outside of the cave his father had made a
bear-ladder for Reddie to learn to climb on.
A bear-ladder is a piece of a tree set up
straight in the ground. It has short, broken-off
limbs, and little bears like to run up and
down on it, and big bears, too, for it gives
them exercise and keeps them in practice
for climbing real trees.</p>

<p>"When Reddie had the idea, he ran out and
looked at his bear-ladder; then he ran back
and looked at the jug. If only that bear-ladder
was in the cave, he thought, he could
walk right up it and get the jug and have the
best time in the world. The bear-ladder
would go in the cave, for it was a very high
cave, and the ladder was not a very tall
one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the bear-ladder was fast to the
ground, and at first Reddie couldn't budge
it. He worked and pushed and tugged,
but it would not move. Then he happened
to think that perhaps if he climbed up to the
top of it, and swung his weight back and forth
as hard as he could, he might loosen it that
way. So he ran up to the top limbs and
caught hold tight, and rocked this way and
that with all his might, and pretty soon he
felt his bear-ladder begin to rock, too. Then
he rocked a good deal harder, and all of a
sudden down it went and little Cousin
Redfield Bear flew over into a pile of stove-wood,
and for ten minutes didn't know
whether he was killed or not, he felt so
poorly. Then he crawled over to a flat
stone and sat down on it, and cried, and felt
of himself to see if he was injured anywhere;
and he did not feel at all like bothering with
his bear-ladder any more, or eating molasses,
either.</p>

<p>"But that was quite early in the day, and
after Cousin Redfield had sat there awhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
he didn't feel so discouraged. His pains
nearly all went away, and he began to feel
that if he had some molasses now it would
cure him. So then he got up and went
over to look at the ladder, and took hold of
it, and found that it wasn't very heavy, as
it was pine, and very dead and dry. He
could drag it to the cave easy enough, but
when he got it there he couldn't set it up
straight. He was too short, and not strong
enough, either.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/z034.jpg" width="362" height="450" alt="&quot;SAT DOWN ON THE STONE TO THINK AGAIN AND CRY SOME MORE&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SAT DOWN ON THE STONE TO THINK AGAIN AND CRY SOME MORE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"So little Cousin Redfield went back and
sat down on his stone to think again and cry
some more, because he found several new
hurting places that were not quite cured yet.
Then, he noticed the clothes-line, and thought
he might do something with that. He could
get that down easy enough, for it was not
very high. Cousin Redfield had often hung
out the clothes on it himself. So he untied
the ends of the clothes-line and tied one end
of it to the top of his bear-ladder, but
didn't know what to do with the other end,
until he happened to see the big hooks in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the top of the cave where his father hung
meat when they had a good supply.</p>

<p>"So then Reddie made a bunch of the other
end of the rope and threw it at those hooks,
and kept on throwing it until after a while it
caught on one of them, and enough of it
hung down for him to get hold of. Cousin
Redfield, for a small bear, was really quite
smart to think of all that.</p>

<p>"It wasn't easy, though, even now, to
get the bear-ladder up straight. Reddie
pulled, and tugged, and propped his feet
against the side of the cave, and the table
and benches, and got out of breath, and was
panting and hot and his sore places hurt
him awful, and he thought he'd have to give
it up, but at last the end of the bear-ladder
caught on the side of the cave where the jug
was, and stayed there, and Cousin Redfield
could let go of the rope, and get behind the
ladder and push, and then, pretty soon, it
was up straight, and he could get the
molasses-jug as easy as anything.</p>

<p>"It was getting along in the afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
now, and Reddie knew that Uncle Brownwood
Bear was likely to come home before
long. So he went right up and got the jug,
and nearly dropped it getting down, it was
so heavy. But he got down with it all right,
and then pulled out the cob that was its
stopper, and tipped the jug to pour some of
the molasses out in his hand.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/z038.jpg" width="363" height="450" alt="&quot;AND THEN PRETTY SOON IT COMMENCED TO RUN BETTER&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AND THEN PRETTY SOON IT COMMENCED TO RUN BETTER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"But the jug was quite full, and, the
molasses being very thick, would not run out
very well. So he tipped the jug over
farther, but could only get a little. Then he
tipped it on its side, and then pretty soon it
commenced to run better, and came out
better, and made a nice noise, 'po-lollop,
po-lollop, po-lollop,' and formed quite a
thick pool right on the floor of the cave, and
little Cousin Redfield Bear got down on his
hands and knees and licked and lapped, and
forgot everything but what a lovely time
he was having, and didn't realize that he was
getting it all over himself, until he started to
get up, and then found it was all around him,
and his knees were in it, and everything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cousin Redfield didn't get entirely up.
He was nearly up when his foot slipped and
he went down flat on his back; when he
tried it again he went down in another
position, and kept on getting partly up and
falling in different ways, until he was an
awful sight, and there wasn't so much
molasses on the floor any more, because it
was nearly all on Cousin Redfield. Then
that little bear&mdash;little Reddie Bear&mdash;suddenly
remembered that his father would
be coming home presently, and that something
ought to be done about it. He was
so full of molasses he could hardly move or
see out of his eyes. If he could only wipe
it off. He had seen his father take a wisp
of hay or nice, soft grass to wipe up a little
that was sometimes spilled on the table, so
Reddie thought hay would be good for his
trouble. He would roll in hay, and that
would take off the molasses.</p>

<p>"There was a big pile of soft hay-grass in
the back part of the cave that Uncle Brownwood
used to stuff his mattress with, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Cousin Redfield made for it, and rolled
and wallowed in it, thinking, at first, that he
was getting off the molasses, but pretty soon
finding he was only getting on hay, and really
had it all over him so thick that he could not
roll any more, and could only see through it
a very little. When he managed to get up
he had nearly all the hay on him, as well
as the molasses.</p>

<p>"Cousin Redfield was really a little walking
haystack; and scared at his condition,
because he thought he would probably
never be a bear any more. He was so
scared that he wanted his father to come and
do something for him, and started to meet
him, as fast as he could, with all that load
of hay and molasses. He was crying, too,
but nobody could really tell it from the
sound he made, which was something like
'Woo&mdash;ooo, woo&mdash;ooo,' and very mournful.</p>

<p>"Uncle Brownwood Bear was just
rounding the big rock there at the turn when
he came face to face with Cousin Redfield
and his hay. Reddie thought his father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
would be angry when he saw him, but he
wasn't&mdash;not at first. Cousin Redfield didn't
realize how he looked from the outside, or
the lonesomeness of the sound he was
making. Uncle Brownwood took just one
glance at him, and said '<i>Woof!</i>' and broke
in the direction of a tree, and of course you
could hardly blame him, for he had never
seen or heard anything like that before, and
it came on him so sudden-like.</p>

<p>"Then poor little Reddie Bear bawled out
as loud as he could, 'Pa! Pa! Oh, pa,
come back! I's me, pa; come back!'</p>

<p>"And Uncle Brownwood stopped in his
tracks and whirled around and said, in an
awful voice, 'You, Redfield!' for he thought
Reddie was playing a joke on him, and he
was mad clear through.</p>

<p>"Cousin Redfield saw that he was mad by
the way he started for him, and became
scared, and tried to run away as well as he
could; but, not being able to see well, ran
right toward the Wide Blue Water, and
before he noticed where he was going he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
stumbled off of a two-foot bank where it
was deep, and was down in the water, and
had gone under for the second time before
his father could lean over and grab him and
get him out.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/z044.jpg" width="356" height="450" alt="&quot;IT GAVE HIM SUCH A SICK TURN THAT HE NEARLY DIED&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT GAVE HIM SUCH A SICK TURN THAT HE NEARLY DIED&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Poor little Cousin Redfield Bear! By
that time most of the hay was washed off
of him, but he had got a good deal of the Wide
Blue Water inside of him, and was so nearly
drowned he couldn't speak. And when his
father laid him on the bank, and rolled him,
the water and molasses came out, 'po-lollop,
po-lollop, po-lollop,' and, feeble as he was,
little Cousin Redfield realized that he
probably would never care for molasses
again.</p>


<p>"When he was empty and could sit up,
Uncle Brownwood got a pail, and a dipper,
and a brush-broom, and cleaned him on the
outside, and then rubbed him dry with an
old towel, and put him to bed, though not
until after he had scrubbed up the cave so
they could live in it.</p>

<p>"Uncle Brownwood Bear did not punish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
little Cousin Redfield," Mr. Crow said. "He
thought Reddie had been punished enough.
Besides, Reddie was sick for several days.
But Uncle Brownwood put up the bear-ladder
much stronger than before, and set
the empty molasses-jug in the middle of the
table, and kept it there a long time, and
when Cousin Redfield tried even to look at
it, it gave him such a sick turn that he
nearly died."</p>

<h2>MR. BEAR'S EARLY SPRING<br />
CALL</h2>

<h3>AN UNWELCOME VISITOR PAYS A VISIT TO
THE HOLLOW TREE</h3>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time when it had been a
hard winter in the Big Deep Woods, and
spring was late, and there was still very little
in the way of fresh food to be had, Mr.
'Possum came in quite excited, one evening,
and after bolting the down-stairs door put
a heavy prop against it, though he called up
first to see if Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow were
both in.</div>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> in," Mr. 'Coon called back. "I hunted
till I was tired and couldn't find a thing worth
bringing home, except some winter parsnips
that I dug out of Mr. Man's garden."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> in," Mr. Crow called back. "I
found a beefsteak that Mr. Man had hung
out to freeze. I'll cook it with Mr. 'Coon's
parsnips. Why, is anything the matter?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/z050.jpg" width="349" height="450" alt="MR. &#39;POSSUM CAME PUFFING UP THE STAIRS" title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. &#39;POSSUM CAME PUFFING UP THE STAIRS</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. 'Possum came puffing up the stairs to
the big room, and sat down before the fire,
and took off his shoes and warmed himself
a little, and lit his pipe, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, there <i>may</i> be, if we don't keep that
prop pretty firmly against the down-stairs
door. I met Mr. Robin while I was out,
and he tells me that a new Mr. Bear has
moved over into the edge of the Big Deep
Woods, into that vacant cave down there by
the lower drift. His name is Savage&mdash;Aspetuck
Savage&mdash;one of those Sinking
Swamp Savages, and he's hungry and pretty
fierce. They've had a harder winter in the
Swamp than we have had up here, and when
Aspetuck came out of his winter nap last
week and couldn't find anything, he started
up this way. Mr. Man has shut up all his
pigs, and Mr. Robin thinks that Aspetuck
is headed now for the Hollow Tree. Somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
told him, Mr. Robin said, that we
manage to live well and generally come
through the winter in pretty fair order,
though I can tell by the way my clothes
hang on me that I've lost several pounds since
Mr. Man built that new wire-protected pen
for his chickens."</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon said the news certainly was not
very good, and that while his condition was
not so bad for such a hard season, he didn't
propose to let Mr. Aspetuck Savage use him
in the place of pork, if he could help it. Mr.
Crow said he didn't feel so much afraid on
his own account, as Aspetuck would not be
apt to have much taste for one of his family,
unless his appetite was extremely fierce,
though, of course, it was safer to take no
chances. So then they all went down-stairs
and put still another prop against the door,
and piled a number of things behind it, too,
to make it safe. Then they went up and
Mr. Crow cooked the nice steak and put some
fried parsnips with it, and Mr. 'Possum said
if it wasn't for thinking of Aspetuck he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
eat twice as much and get his lost weight
back; and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow told
him he had better keep right on thinking
of Aspetuck, so there would be enough to go
around. By and by they all sat before the
fire and smoked, and got sleepy, and Mr.
'Coon and Mr. 'Possum went up to their
rooms to bed, but Mr. Crow said he would
nap in his chair, so that if Mr. Savage Bear
should arrive early he would be up to
receive him.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm very sick," said Mr. 'Coon,
"and too run-down and feeble to get up to
make him welcome."</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm dead," said Mr. 'Possum.
"Say I died last week, and you're only
waiting for the ground to thaw to bury
me. Tell Aspetuck I starved to death."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/z052.jpg" width="358" height="450" alt="DID NOT REALLY INTEND TO GO SOUND ASLEEP" title="" />
<span class="caption">DID NOT REALLY INTEND TO GO SOUND ASLEEP</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Crow said he would tell as many
things as he could think of, and then he sat
down by the fire, and did not really intend
to go sound asleep, but he did, and the fire
went down, and Mr. Crow got pretty cold,
though he didn't know it until all of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sudden, just about sunrise, there was a big
pounding knock at the down-stairs door,
and a big, deep voice called out:</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello! Wake up! Here's a
visitor to the Hollow Tree!"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Crow jumped straight up, and
almost cracked, his joints were so stiff and
cold, and Mr. 'Coon heard it, and jumped
straight up, too, in his bed; and Mr. 'Possum
heard it, and jumped straight up in
<i>his</i> bed, and Mr. 'Coon said, "'Sh!" and
Mr. 'Possum said, "'Sh!" and Mr. Crow
stumbled over to the window and opened it
and looked out, and said: "Who's there?"
Though he really didn't have to ask, because
he knew, and besides, he could see the biggest
Mr. Bear he ever saw, for Aspetuck Savage
was seven feet tall, and of very heavy build.</p>

<p>"It's me," said Mr. Bear, "Mr. Aspetuck
S. Bear, come to make a spring morning
call." You see, he left out his middle name,
and only gave the initial, because he knew
his full name wasn't popular in the Deep
Woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Bear, good morning!" said
Mr. Crow. "How early you are! I didn't
know it was spring, and I didn't know it
was morning. I'm sorry not to invite you
in, but we've had a hard time lately, and
haven't cleaned house yet, and I'd be
ashamed to let you see how we look."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that," said Mr. Aspetuck
Bear. "I don't care how things look. I
forget everything else in the spring feeling.
I only want to enjoy your society, especially
Mr. 'Coon's. I've heard he's so fine and
fat and good-natured, in his old age."</p>

<p>When Mr. 'Coon heard that he fell back
in bed and covered his head and groaned,
but not loud enough for Aspetuck to hear
him.</p>

<p>And Mr. Crow said: "Ah, poor Mr.
'Coon! You have not heard the latest.
The hard winter has been a great strain on
him and lately he has been very poorly.
He is quite frail and feeble, and begs to be
excused."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Mr. Bear. "Why, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
heard as I came along that Mr. 'Coon was
out yesterday and was never looking better."</p>

<p>"All a mistake&mdash;all a mistake, Mr. Bear.
Must have been his cousin from Rocky
Hollow. They look very much alike. I'm
greatly worried about Mr. 'Coon."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mr. Savage Bear, "it
doesn't matter much. Mr. 'Possum will
do just as well. So fine and fat, I am told&mdash;I
was quite reminded of one of Mr. Man's
pigs I once enjoyed."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 358px;">

<span class="caption">WHEN MR. &#39;POSSUM HEARD THAT HE FAINTED DEAD AWAY</span>
</div>

<p>When Mr. 'Possum heard that he fainted
dead away, but was not so far gone that he
couldn't hear what Mr. Crow said. Mr.
Crow wiped his eyes with a new handkerchief
before he said anything.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bear," he called back, "it's so
sad about Mr. 'Possum. We shall never see
his like again. He had such a grand figure,
and such a good appetite&mdash;and to think it
should prove his worst enemy."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what's the matter&mdash;what's happened?
You don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;the appetite was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
strong for him&mdash;it carried him off. Mr.
'Coon and I did our best to supply it.
That is what put Mr. 'Coon to bed and I am
just a shadow of my old self. We worked
to save our dear Mr. 'Possum. We hunted
nights and we hunted days, to keep him in
chicken pie with dumplings and gravy, but
that beautiful appetite of his seemed to
grow and grow until we couldn't keep up
with it, this hard year, and one day our
noble friend said:</p>

<p>"'Don't try any more&mdash;the more I eat
the more I want&mdash;good-by.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Crow wiped his eyes again, while Mr.
Bear grumbled to himself something about
a nice state of affairs; but pretty soon he
seemed to listen, for Mr. 'Possum was
smacking his lips, thinking of those chicken
pies Mr. Crow had described, and Mr. Bear
has very quick ears.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crow," he said, "do you think Mr.
'Possum is really as dead as he might be?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Mr. Bear&mdash;at least twice as dead,
from the looks of him" (for Mr. 'Possum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had suddenly fainted again). "We're just
waiting for the ground to thaw to have the
funeral."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Crow, I think I'll just come up
and take a look at the remains, and visit
<i>you</i> a little, and maybe say a word to poor
Mr. 'Coon."</p>

<p>When Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum heard
that they climbed out of their beds and got
under them, for they didn't know what
might happen next.</p>

<p>And they heard Mr. Crow say: "I'm
awfully sorry, Mr. Bear, but the down-stairs
door is locked, and bolted, and barred, and
propped, and all our things piled against it,
for winter; and I can't get it open until Mr.
'Coon gets strong enough to help me."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that," said A. Savage
Bear, "I can make a run or two against it,
and it will come down all right. I weigh
seven hundred pounds."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/z060.jpg" width="341" height="460" alt="FLUNG HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOWN-STAIRS DOOR WITH A GREAT BANG" title="" />
<span class="caption">FLUNG HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOWN-STAIRS DOOR WITH A GREAT BANG</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum had crept out
to listen, but when they heard that they
dodged back under their beds again, and got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the darkest corners, and began to groan,
and just then Mr. Bear gave a run and flung
himself against the down-stairs door with a
great bang, and both of them howled,
because they couldn't help it, they were so
scared, and Mr. Crow was worried, because
he knew that about the second charge, or
the third, that door would be apt to give
way, and then things in the Hollow Tree
would become very mixed, and even
dangerous.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow didn't know what to do next.
He saw Mr. Savage Bear back off a good deal
further than he had the first time, and come
for the down-stairs door as hard as he could
tear, and when he struck it that time, the
whole Hollow Tree shook, and Mr. 'Coon
and Mr. 'Possum howled so loud that Mr.
Crow was sure Mr. Bear could hear them.
They were all in an awful fix, Mr. Crow
thought, and was just going to look for a
safe place for himself when who should come
skipping through the tree-tops but Mr.
Robin. Mr. Robin, though quite small, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
not afraid of any Mr. Bear, because he is
good friends with everybody. He saw right
away how things were at the Hollow Tree&mdash;in
fact, he had hurried over, thinking there
might be trouble there.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tucky," he called&mdash;Tucky being
Mr. Aspetuck Savage Bear's pet name&mdash;"I've
brought you some good news&mdash;some
of the very best kind of news."</p>

<p>Mr. Bear was just that minute getting
fixed for his third run. "What is it?" he
said, holding himself back.</p>

<p>"I found a big honey-tree, yesterday
evening," Mr. Robin said. "The biggest one
I ever saw. I'll show you the way, if you
care for honey."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Bear likes honey better than
anything in the world, and when he heard
about the big tree Mr. Robin had found he
licked out his tongue and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> I like honey," he said,
"especially for dessert. I'll be ready to go
with you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
crept out to listen, fell over at those words,
and rolled back under the beds again.</p>

<p>"But you ought not to wait a minute,
Tucky dear," Mr. Robin said. "It's going
to be warm when the sun gets out, and those
bees will be lively and pretty fierce."</p>

<p>Mr. Savage Bear scratched his head, and
his tongue hung out, thinking of the nice
honey he might lose.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful honey, Tucky&mdash;clover
honey, white and fresh."</p>

<p>A. Savage Bear's tongue hung out farther,
and seemed fairly to drip. "Where is that
tree?" he said.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 327px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;I HOPE MR. &#39;POSSUM&#39;S FUNERAL WILL BE A SUCCESS&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"In the edge of the Sinking Swamps,"
said Mr. Robin. "Not far from your home.
You can eat all you want and carry at least
a bushel to your folks. You ought to be
starting, as I say, before it warms up.
Besides, a good many are out looking for
honey-trees, just now."</p>

<p>Mr. Aspetuck Savage Bear just wheeled
in his tracks and started south, which was
the direction of the Sinking Swamps.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"You lead the way," he called to Mr.
Robin, "and I'll be there by breakfast-time.
I'm mighty glad you happened along,
for there looks to be a poor chance for
supplies around here. I've heard a lot about
the Big Deep Woods, but give me the
Sinking Swamps, every time." Then he
looked back and called: "Good-by, Mr. Crow.
Best wishes to poor Mr. 'Coon, and I hope
Mr. 'Possum's funeral will be a success."</p>

<p>And Mr. Crow called good-by, and
motioned to Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum,
who had crept out again a little, and they
slipped over to the window and peeked out,
and saw Mr. Aspetuck Savage Bear following
Mr. Robin back to the Sinking Swamps, to
the honey-tree which Mr. Robin had really
found there, for Mr. Robin is a good bird,
and never deceives anybody.</p>

<h2>MR. JACK RABBIT BRINGS A<br />
FRIEND</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<h3>A NEW ARRIVAL IN THE BIG DEEP WOODS
TELLS A STORY</h3>

<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time Mr. Jack Rabbit
gave the Hollow Tree people a real
surprise. It was a pleasant spring evening,
and the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old
Black Crow were sitting outside after supper,
and somebody had just remarked that it was
a good while since they had seen Jack Rabbit,
when Mr. Rabbit himself happened along
and, for the first time they could remember,
brought somebody with him. Then everybody
jumped up, of course, to say, "Good
evening," and Jack Rabbit said:</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/z070.jpg" width="351" height="450" alt="&quot;I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO WONDERFUL AS THE WAY SHE TELLS IT&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO WONDERFUL AS THE WAY SHE TELLS IT&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"This is a new friend I have made&mdash;possibly
a distant relative, as we seem to
belong to about the same family, though,
of course, it doesn't really make any difference.
Her name is Myrtle&mdash;Miss Myrtle
Meadows&mdash;and she has had a most exciting,
and very strange, and really quite
awful adventure. I have brought her over
because I know you will all be glad to hear
about it. I have never heard anything so
wonderful as the way she tells it."</p>

<p>Mr. Rabbit looked at Miss Meadows, and
Miss Meadows tried to look at Jack Rabbit,
but was quite shy and modest at being
praised before everybody in that way. Then
Mr. 'Coon brought her a nice little low chair,
and she sat down, and they all asked her to
tell about her great adventure, because they
said they were tired of hearing their own
old stories told over and over, and nearly
always in the same way, though Mr. 'Possum
could change his some when he tried. So
then Miss Myrtle began to tell her story,
but kept looking down at her lap at first,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
being so bashful among such perfect strangers
as the Hollow Tree people were to her at
that time.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I wasn't born in the
Big Deep Woods, nor in any woods at all,
but in a house with a great many more of
our family, a long way from here, and
owned by a Mr. Man who raised us to sell."</p>

<p>When Miss Myrtle said that the 'Coon
and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow took
their pipes out of their mouths and looked
at her with very deep interest. They had
once heard from Mr. Dog about menageries,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
where Deep Woods people and others were
kept for Mr. Man and his friends to look at,
but they had never heard of a place where
any of their folks were raised to sell. Mr.
'Possum was just going to ask a question&mdash;probably
as to how they were fed&mdash;when
Mr. Rabbit said, "'Sh!" and Miss Meadows
went on:</p>

<p>"It was quite a nice place, and we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
pretty thick in the little house, which was a
good deal like a cage, with strong wires in
front, though it had doors, too, to shut us
in when it rained or was cold. Mr. Man, or
some of his family, used to bring us fresh
grass and clover and vegetables to eat,
every day, and sometimes would open a door
and let us out for a short time on the green
lawn. We never went far, or thought of
running away, but ran in, pretty soon, and
cuddled down, sometimes almost in a pile,
we were so thick; and we were all very happy
indeed.</p>

<p>"But one day Mr. Man came to our house
and opened the door and reached in and
lifted several of us out&mdash;about twenty or so,
I should think&mdash;one after another, by the
ears&mdash;and put us into a flat box with slats
across the top, and said, 'Now you little
chaps are going to have a trip and see
something.' I didn't know what he meant,
but I can see now that he didn't mean nearly
so much as happened&mdash;not in <i>my</i> case. A
number of my brothers and sisters were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the box with me, and though we were quite
frightened, we were excited, too, for we
wondered where we were going, and what
wonderful things we should see."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/z074.jpg" width="353" height="450" alt="MISS MYRTLE PAUSED AND WIPED HER EYES" title="" />
<span class="caption">MISS MYRTLE PAUSED AND WIPED HER EYES</span>
</div>

<p>Miss Myrtle paused and wiped her eyes
with a handkerchief that looked very much
like one of Jack Rabbit's; then she said:</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall never know what became
of all the others of our poor little broken
family, and I know they are wondering what
became of me, but of course there is no way
to find out now, and Mr. Jack Rabbit says
I must try to forget and be happy.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Man put the box into a wagon
and we rode and rode, and were so frightened,
for we had never done such a thing before,
and by and by we came to a very big town&mdash;a
place with ever so many houses and all the
Mr. Mans and their families in the world,
I should think, and so much noise that we all
lay flat and tried to bury our heads, to keep
from being made deaf. By and by Mr. Man
stopped and took our box from the wagon,
and another Mr. Man stepped out of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
place that I learned later was a kind of store
where they sell things, and the new Mr. Man
took our box and set it in front of his store,
and put a card on it with some words that
said, 'For Sale,' and threw us in some green
stuff to eat, and there we were, among ever so
many things that we had never seen before.</p>

<p>"Well, it was not very long until a tall
Mr. Man and his little boy stopped and
looked at us, and Mr. Store Man came out
and lifted up the cover of our box and held
us up, one after the other, by the ears, until
he came to Tip, one of my brothers who
wasn't very smart, but was quite good-looking
and had a tuft of white on his ears
which made him have that name. Mr.
Man's boy said he would take Tip, and Tip
giggled and was so pleased because he had
been picked first. Mr. Store Man put him
in a big paper bag, and that was the last we
saw of Tip. I hope he did not have the
awful experience I had, though, of course,
everything is all right now," and Miss
Myrtle looked at Jack Rabbit, who looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at Miss Myrtle and said that no harm should
come to her ever again.</p>

<p>"Smut was next to go&mdash;a nice little chap
with a blackish nose. A little girl of Mr.
Man's bought him, and it was another little
girl that bought me. She looked at all of us a
good while, and pretty soon she happened to
see that I was looking at her, and she said
she could see in my eyes that I was asking
her to take me, which was so, and pretty
soon I was in a bag, too, and when the little
girl opened the bag I was in her house&mdash;a
very fine place, with a number of wonderful
things in it besides her family, and plenty
to eat&mdash;much more than I wanted, though I
had a good appetite, being young.</p>

<p>"I was very lonesome, though, for there
were none of the Rabbit family there, and
I had nobody to talk to, or cuddle up to at
night. I had a little house all to myself, but
often through the day my little girl would
hold me and stroke my fur, trying as hard as
she could to make me happy and enjoy her
society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I really did enjoy it, too, sometimes,
when she did not squeeze me too hard, which
she couldn't help, she was so fond of me.
When I would sit up straight and wash my
face, as I did every morning, she would call
everybody to see me, and said I was the
dearest thing in the world."</p>

<p>When Miss Meadows said that Jack
Rabbit looked at her with his head tipped a
little to one side, as if he were trying to
decide whether Mr. Man's little girl had been
right or not. Then he looked at the Hollow
Tree people and said:</p>

<p>"H'm! H'm! Very nice little girl"
(meaning Mr. Man's, of course), "and very
smart, too."</p>

<p>"I got used to being without my own
folks," Miss Meadows went on, "but I did
not forget the nice green grass of the country,
and always wanted to go back to it. If I
had known what was going to happen to me
in the country I should not have been so
anxious to get there.</p>

<p>"I had been living with that little girl and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her family about a month, I suppose, when
one day she came running to my house and
took me out, and said:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Brownie'&mdash;that was her name for
me&mdash;'we are going to the country, Brownie
dear, where you can run and play on the
green grass, and eat fresh clover, and have
the best time.'</p>

<p>"Well, of course I was delighted, and we
did go to the country, but I did not have the
best time&mdash;at least, not for long.</p>

<p>"It was all right at the start. We went
in Mr. Man's automobile. I had never seen
one before, and it was very scary at first.
I was in a box on the back seat with Mr.
Man's little girl and her mother, and I stood
up most of the time, and looked over the top
of the box at the world going by so fast that
it certainly seemed to be turning around, as
I once heard the little girl say it really did.
When we began to come to the country I
saw the grass and woods and houses, all in
a whirl, and the little girl helped me so I
could see better, and my heart beat so fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that I thought it was going to tear me to
pieces. I felt as if I must jump out and
run away, but she held me very tight, and
by and by I grew more peaceful.</p>

<p>"We got there that evening, and it was a
lovely place. There was a large lawn of
grass, and some big trees, and my little girl
let me run about the lawn, though I was
still so scared that I wanted to hide in every
good place I saw. So she put me in a pretty
new house that had a door, and wire net
windows to look out of, and then set the
little house out in the yard and gave me
plenty of fresh green food, and I was just
getting used to everything when the awful
thing happened.</p>

<p>"It happened at night, the worst time, of
course, for terrible things, and they generally
seem to come then. It was such a pleasant
evening that my little girl thought it would
be well for me to stay in my house outside,
instead of having me in the big house, which
she thought I did not care for, and that was
true, though I can see now that the big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
house would have been safer at such a
time.</p>

<p>"So I stayed in my little house out on the
terrace, and thought how pleasant it was out
there, and nibbled some nice carrot tops she
had put in for me, and watched the lights
commence to go out in the big house, and
saw my little girl come to the window and
look out at me, and then her light went out,
too, and pretty soon I suppose I must have
gone to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<h3>MISS MYRTLE MEADOWS CONTINUES HER
ADVENTURES</h3>

<div class='cap'>"REALLY, I don't know what time it was
that I woke up, but I know I did not
wake up naturally. I just seemed to jump
out of my sleep, and I was wide-awake in a
second. Something was clawing and scratching
at one of my wire windows, and then I
saw two big, fiery eyes, and knew it was some
fierce creature, and that it was after me.
Well, I thought I had been scared before in
my short life, but I could see now that I had
never really known what it was to be scared.
I didn't see how I could live from one minute
to the next, I was in such a state, and
I couldn't move hand or foot.</div>

<p>"I knew what it was after me. Our Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Man had a big old Mr. Dog that I had seen
looking at me very interestedly once before
when my little girl carried my house past
him. They kept him fastened with a chain,
but somehow he had worked himself loose,
and now he had come to make a late supper
out of poor defenseless me. I would have
talked to him, and tried to shame him out
of it, but I was too scared even to speak,
for he was biting and clawing at that wire
net window as hard as he could, and I could
see that it was never going to keep him out,
for it was beginning to give way, and all of
a sudden it did give way, and his big old
head came smashing right through into my
house, and I expected in another second to
be dead.</p>

<p>"But just in that very second I seemed to
come to life. I didn't have anything to do
with it at all. My legs suddenly turned into
springs and sent me flying out under old
Mr. Dog's neck, between his forefeet; then
they turned into wings, and if I touched the
ground again for at least three miles I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
remember it. I could hear old Mr. Dog
back there, and I could tell by his language
that he was mad. He thought he was
chasing me, but he wasn't. He was just
wallowing through the bushes and across a
boggy place that I had sailed over like a bird.
If he could have seen how fast I was going he
would have thought he was standing still.
But he was old and foolish, and kept
blundering along, until I couldn't hear him
any more, he was so far behind. Then,
by and by, it was morning, and I <i>really</i>
came to life and found I was tired and
hungry and didn't know in the least where
I was.</p>

<p>"There didn't seem to be anything to eat
there, either, but only leaves and woods;
and I was afraid to taste such green things
as I saw, because they were wild and might
make me sick. So I went on getting more
tired and hungry and lost, and was nearly
ready to give up when I heard some one
call, just overhead, and I looked up, and
saw a friendly-looking bird who said his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
name was Mr. Robin, and asked if there
was anything he could do for me. When I
told him how tired and hungry I was, he
came down and showed me some things I
could eat without danger, and invited me
home with him. He said I was in the Big
Deep Woods, and that there was a vacant
room in the tree where he and Mrs. Robin
had their nest and I could stay there as long
as I liked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/z084.jpg" width="354" height="450" alt="&quot;SO I WENT HOME WITH MR. ROBIN&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SO I WENT HOME WITH MR. ROBIN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"So I went home with Mr. Robin, and
Mrs. Robin was ever so kind, and said she
thought I must be of the same family as
Mr. Jack Rabbit, because we resembled a
good deal, and sent over for him right away.
I was ever so glad to think I was going to
see one of my own folks again, and when
Mr. Rabbit came we sat right down, and I
told him my story, and we tried to trace
back and see what relation we were, but it
was too far back, and besides, I was too
young when I left home to know much about
my ancestors. Mr. Rabbit said if we were
related at all it must be through his mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as she was very handsome, and he thought
I looked like her a good deal. He said what
a fine thing it was that I had quit being a
house rabbit and had decided to be a wild,
free rabbit in the Big Deep Woods, though,
of course, it was really old Mr. Dog who
decided it for me, and I was quite sorry to
leave my little girl, who was always so good
to me and loved me very much. It makes
me sad when I remember how I saw her at
the window, that last time, but I don't
think I want to go back, anyway, now since
Jack&mdash;Mr. Rabbit, I mean&mdash;is teaching
me all about Deep Woods life and says
he is not going to let me go back at all&mdash;ever!"</p>

<p>Little Miss Myrtle all at once seemed
very much embarrassed again, and looked
down into her lap, and Mr. Jack Rabbit
seemed quite embarrassed, too, when he
tried to say something, because he had to
cough two or three times before he could
get started.</p>

<p>"H'm! H'm!" he said. "Now that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
have all heard Miss Meadows's wonderful
story, and what a narrow escape she had&mdash;an
escape which those present can understand,
for all of us have had close calls in our
time&mdash;I am sure you will be glad to hear that
the little stranger has consented to remain
in the Big Deep Woods and share such of
the Deep Woods fortunes as I can provide
for her. In fact&mdash;I may say&mdash;h'm!
that&mdash;h'm!&mdash;Miss Meadows a week from
to-day is to become&mdash;h'm!&mdash;Mrs. Jack
Rabbit."</p>

<p>Then all the Hollow Tree people jumped
right up and ran over to shake hands with
Mr. Rabbit and Miss Myrtle Meadows, and
Mr. 'Possum said they must have a big
wedding, because big weddings always meant
good things to eat, and that everybody
must come, and that he would show them
how a wedding was to be enjoyed. Mr.
Crow promised to cook his best things, and
Mr. 'Coon said he would think up some
performances for the guests to do, and then
everybody began to talk about it, until it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was quite late before Jack Rabbit and Miss
Meadows walked away toward Mr. Robin's,
calling back, "Good night!" to their good
friends of the Hollow Tree.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2>MR. RABBIT'S WEDDING</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<h3>THE HOLLOW TREE PEOPLE GATHER TO
CELEBRATE A GREAT EVENT</h3>

<div class='cap'>"WELL, you remember that I told you
about Mr. Jack Rabbit and Miss
Myrtle Meadows, and the wedding they had
planned," says the Story Teller one pleasant
afternoon when he and the Little Lady have
been taking a long walk and are resting in
the shade in the very edge of the Big Deep
Woods.</div>

<p>The Little Lady nods. "But you never
told me about the wedding," she says,
"and I want to hear about that more than
anything. They <i>had</i> a wedding, didn't
they?&mdash;the Hollow Tree people were going
to get it up, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, they did; and there was never such
a wedding in the Big Deep Woods. This
was the way it was:"</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum began to plan right away all
the things that Mr. Crow was to cook, and
went out every night to help bring in something,
though Mr. 'Possum is not a great
hand for work, in general, except when
somebody else does it. Mr. 'Coon went
right to work on the program of things to be
done at the wedding, and decided to have a
regular circus, where everybody in the Big
Deep Woods could show what he could do
best, or what he used to do best when he
was young. Every little while Jack Rabbit
and Miss Meadows walked over to talk about
it, and by and by they came over and wrote
out all the invitations, which Mr. Robin
promised to deliver, though he had once
made a big mistake with an invitation by
having a hole in his pocket.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/z094.jpg" width="346" height="450" alt="STOPPED TO TALK A LITTLE WITH EACH ONE" title="" />
<span class="caption">STOPPED TO TALK A LITTLE WITH EACH ONE</span>
</div>

<p>But Mr. Robin didn't make any mistake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
this time, and went around from place to
place, and stopped to talk a little with each
one, because he is friends with everybody.
Mr. Redfield Bear and Mr. Turtle and Mr.
Squirrel and Mr. Dog and Mr. Fox all said
they would come, and would certainly bring
something for the happy couple, for it wasn't
every day that one got a chance to attend
such a wedding as Jack Rabbit's would be;
and everybody remembered how the bride
had come to the Deep Woods in that most
romantic and strange way, after having been
brought up with Mr. Man's people, and all
wanted to know what she looked like, and if
she spoke with much accent, and what she
was going to wear, and if Mr. Robin thought
she would be satisfied to stay in the Deep
Woods, which must seem a great change;
and if she had a pleasant disposition. They
knew, of course, Mr. Robin would be apt to
know about most of those things, because she
had been staying at his house ever since that
awful night when she escaped from old Mr.
Dog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Robin said he had never known any
one with a sweeter nature than Miss Myrtle's,
and that old Mr. Dog's loss had been the
Big Deep Woods' gain. Then he told them
as much as he knew about the wedding, and
what each one was expected to do, as a performance,
and hurried home to help Mrs.
Robin, who was as busy as she could be, getting
the bride's outfit ready and teaching
her something about housekeeping, though
Jack Rabbit, who had been a bachelor such
a long time, would know a number of things,
too.</p>

<p>Well, they decided to have the wedding out
under some big trees by the Race Track, because
that would give a good, open place for
the performances, which everybody was soon
practicing. Mr. Crow was especially busy,
because he was going to show how he used to
fly. Every morning he was out there very
early, running and flapping about, and every
afternoon he was cooking, right up to the day
of the wedding.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum was up himself, <i>that</i> morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
almost before daylight, going around and
looking at all the things Mr. Crow had
cooked, tasting a little of most of them,
though he had already tasted of everything
at least seven times while the cooking was
going on; and he said that if there was one
thing in the world that would tempt him
to get married it was having a wedding
given him such as Mr. Rabbit's was going
to be.</p>

<p>Then when Mr. Crow and Mr. 'Coon had
snatched a cup of coffee and a bite they all
gathered up the fine cakes and chicken pies
and puddings and things and started for the
Race Track, for the wedding was going to
begin pretty early and last all day.</p>

<p>It looked a little cloudy in the morning, but
it cleared up before long, and was as fine a
June day as anybody could ask for. As soon
as the Hollow Tree people came they put
down their things and began practising their
performances for the last time. Mr. Crow
said if he was going to do his old flying trick
it was well that he had one more try at it; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he got in light flying costume and started
from a limb, and did pretty well for any one
that had been out of practice so long; and he
could even rise from the ground by going out
on the Race Track and taking a running
start. Then, by and by, Mr. Redfield Bear
came along, bringing a box of fine maple
sugar for the young couple, and Mr. Fox
came with a brand-new feather bed, and Mr.
Squirrel brought a big nut cake which Mrs.
Squirrel had made, and sent ahead by <i>him</i>
because she might be a little late, on account
of the children.</p>

<p>Then Jack Rabbit himself came with the
finest clothes on they had ever seen him wear,
and with a beautiful bouquet, and carrying
a new handkerchief and a pair of gloves and
a cane. Everybody stood right up when he
walked in, and said they had never seen him
look so young and handsome and well-dressed;
and Mr. Rabbit bowed and said,
"To be happy is to be young&mdash;to be young is
to be handsome&mdash;to be handsome is to be
well-dressed." Then everybody said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
besides all those things Jack Rabbit was certainly
the smartest person in the Big Deep
Woods.</p>

<p>And just then Mr. and Mrs. Robin arrived
with the bride, and when the Deep Woods
people saw her they just clasped their hands
and couldn't say a word, for she took their
breath quite away.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows was almost overcome, too,
with embarrassment, and was looking down
at the ground, so she didn't see who was there
at first; but when she happened to look up
and saw Mr. Bear she threw up her arms and
would have fallen fainting if Jack Rabbit
hadn't caught her, for she had never seen
such a large, fierce-looking Deep Woods person
before. But Jack Rabbit told her right
away that this was not any of the Savage
Bear family, but Cousin Redfield, one of the
Brownwood Bears, who had been friendly a
long time with all Deep Woods people, and
he showed her the nice present Mr. Bear had
brought. So then she thanked Cousin Redfield
Bear very prettily, though she looked as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
if she might fly into Jack Rabbit's arms at
any moment.</p>

<p>She did more than that presently, though
not on Mr. Bear's account. Everybody was
busy getting things ready when in walked
Mr. Dog, all dressed up and with a neat
package in his hand.</p>

<span class="caption">JACK RABBIT WOULD HAVE STAYED A BACHELOR IF SHE HADN&#39;T TRIPPED IN HER WEDDING-GOWN</span>
</div>

<p>Well, nobody had thought to tell Miss
Meadows about this <i>good</i> Mr. Dog who lived
with Mr. Man in the edge of the Deep Woods
and had been friendly with the Hollow Tree
people so long, and when everybody said,
"Why, here's Mr. Dog! How do you do,
Mr. Dog?" she whirled around and then gave
a wild cry and made the longest leap the
Hollow Tree people had ever seen&mdash;they said
so, afterward&mdash;and never stopped to faint,
but dashed away, and Jack Rabbit would
have stayed a bachelor if she hadn't tripped
in her wedding-gown; though Jack was in
time to catch her before she fell, which saved
her dress from damage. Then Mr. Rabbit
explained to her all about this Mr. Dog, and
coaxed her back, and Mr. Dog made his best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
bow and offered his present&mdash;a nice new
cook-book which somebody had sent to Mrs.
Man, who said she didn't want it, because
she had her old one with a great many of her
own recipes written in. He said he thought
it was just the thing for the bride to start new
with, and she would, of course, add her own
recipes, too, in time. Mr. Crow said he
would give her some of his best ones, right
away, especially the ones for the things he
had brought to-day, which ought to be eaten
now, pretty soon, while they were fresh. So
that reminded them all of the wedding, and
Miss Meadows thanked Mr. Dog for his
handsome and useful present, and just then
Mr. Turtle came in, bringing some beautiful
bridal wreaths he had promised to make, and
right behind him was Mr. Owl, who is
thought to be wise, and is Doctor and Preacher
and Lawyer in the Big Deep Woods, and
performs all the ceremonies.</p>

<p>So then everybody had come, and there
was nothing to wait for, and Mr. Jack Rabbit
led Miss Meadows out in the center of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
nice shade, and Mr. Owl stood before them,
and all the other Deep Woods people arranged
themselves in a circle except Mr. and
Mrs. Robin, who stood by the bride and
groom.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Owl said, "Are all present?"</p>

<p>And everybody said, "All present who
have been invited."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Owl said, "Who gives this bride
away?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Mr. Robin, "though she isn't
really mine, because I only happened to find
her one morning when&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/z104.jpg" width="351" height="450" alt="&quot;MAY YOU BE HAPPY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, AND LONGER&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MAY YOU BE HAPPY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, AND LONGER&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Robin was going on to explain all
about it, but Mr. Owl said, "'Sh!" and went
right on:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack Rabbit, Mr. Robin gives you
Miss Myrtle Meadows to love and cherish
and obey, and Mr. Dog has brought a cook-book,
and Mr. Bear some maple sugar, and
all the others have brought good things.
The wedding-feast is therefore waiting. What
is left will be yours. Let us hope there
will still be the cook-book, but Miss Myrtle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Meadows will not be with us, for I now pronounce
her to be Mrs. Jack Rabbit, and may
you be happy as long as possible, and longer."</p>

<p>Then everybody became suddenly excited
and pushed up to congratulate Mr. and Mrs.
Rabbit, and when the bride heard herself
called "Mrs. Jack Rabbit" she was more embarrassed
than ever, and couldn't get used to
it for at least two minutes. Then they all
sat down and ate and ate, and Mr. 'Possum
said he never felt so romantic in his life,
which was all he did say, except, "Please pass
the chicken pie," or, "A little more gravy,
please."</p>

<p>Well, when they had all had about enough,
except Mr. 'Possum, who was still taking a
taste of this and a bite of that, where things
were in reach, Mr. Rabbit got up and said he
had written a little something for the occasion,
and if they cared to hear it he would
read it now.</p>

<p>So then they all said, "Read it! Read it!"
and Jack Rabbit stood up very nice and
straight, and read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<h3>THE GREAT PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED
THE WEDDING-DINNER</h3>

<div class='cap'>WHEN Mr. Rabbit finished everybody
applauded and he made a nice bow,
though he said that in the last stanza there
was an imperfect rhyme which he hoped they
would excuse for the sake of the great feeling
in it; and everybody said, "Yes, yes," and
then when they were quiet Mr. 'Coon rose
and said that now the program of performances
would begin, and that it would open
and close with flying exhibitions&mdash;the first by
Mr. and Mrs. Robin, and the last by Mr.
Crow, who, though a good deal out of practice,
had promised to give them a sample of
old-fashioned flying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></div>

<p>Everybody cheered, of course, and then
Mr. and Mrs. Robin suddenly sprang up into
the air and began circling around and around
and darting over and under, in the very
prettiest way, and so fast that it almost made
one dizzy to watch them. Sometimes they
would seem to be standing straight up, facing
each other for a few seconds, then they would
whirl over and over in regular somersaults,
suddenly darting high up in the air, sailing
down, at last, in a regular spiral, and landing
on the grass right in front of the bride and
groom.</p>

<p>Then all clapped their hands and said it
was the most wonderful thing ever seen, and
Mr. Crow said if he should try to fly like that
he would never know afterward whether his
head was on right or not.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Coon rose to remark that Mr.
Fox was next on the program and would give
a little exhibition in light and fancy running.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox, who hadn't eaten as much dinner
as he might, because he wanted to be in good
trim for his performance, got right up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with a leap landed out on the Race Track,
and then for the next five minutes they could
hardly tell whether he was running or flying,
he leaped so lightly and skipped so swiftly,
his fine, bushy tail waving like a beautiful,
graceful plume that seemed to guide him this
way and that and to be just the thing for
Mr. Fox's purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox was applauded, too, when he sat
down, and so was Mr. Squirrel, who came
next, and showed that <i>his</i> bushy tail was also
useful, for he gave a leaping exhibition from
one limb to another, and leaped farther and
farther each time, until they thought he
would surely injure himself; but he never did
and he got as much applause as Mr. Fox
when he finally landed right in front of the
bride and groom and made a neat bow.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Turtle gave a heavy-weight carrying
exhibition, and let all get on his back
that could stick on, and walked right down
the same Race Track where so long before he
had run the celebrated race with Mr. Hare,
and said when he came back he felt just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
young and able to-day as he had then, and
was much stronger in the shell.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/z110.jpg" width="344" height="450" alt="IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN COUSIN REDFIELD DANCE" title="" />
<span class="caption">IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN COUSIN REDFIELD DANCE</span>
</div>

<p>Cousin Redfield Bear danced. Nobody
thought he was going to do that. They
thought he would likely give a climbing exhibition,
or something of the kind. But he
didn't&mdash;he danced. And if you could have
seen Cousin Redfield dance, with his arms
akimbo, and his head thrown back, and
watch him cut the pigeon-wing, you would
have understood why he wanted to do it.
He knew it would amuse them and make
them want to dance, too; which it did, and
pretty soon they were in a circle around him,
bride and groom and all, dancing around and
around and singing the Hollow Tree song,
which all the Deep Woods people know.</p>

<p>They danced until they were tired, and
then it was Mr. Dog's turn to do something.
Mr. Dog said he couldn't fly, though certainly
he would like to; and he couldn't run
like Mr. Fox, or jump like Mr. Squirrel, or
make poetry like Mr. Rabbit, or dance like
Mr. Bear&mdash;though once, a long time ago, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
some of them might remember, he had taken
a dancing-lesson from Jack Rabbit.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He
couldn't do any of those things as well as
the others, he said, so he would just make a
little speech called:</p>

<h3>
MR. MAN<br />
</h3>

<p>"Mr. Man is my friend, and we live together.
He is always my friend, though you
might not suspect it, sometimes, the things
he says to me. But he is, and I am Mr.
Man's friend, through thick and thin.</p>

<p>"I am also the friend, now, of the Deep
Woods people, and expect to remain so, because
I have learned to know them and they
have learned to know me. That is the
trouble about the Deep Woods people and
Mr. Man. They don't know each other.
The Deep Woods people think that Mr. Man
is after them, and there is some truth in it,
because Mr. Man thinks the Deep Woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
people are after him, or his property, when, of
course, all Deep Woods people know that it
was never intended that Mr. Man should
own all the chickens, and they are obliged to
borrow one, now and then, in order to have
chicken pie, such as has been served on this
happy occasion.</p>

<p>"I am looking forward to the day when
Mr. Man will understand this, as well as the
Hollow Tree people do, and will become
friendly and open his heart and hen-house to
all who would enter in."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/z116.jpg" width="345" height="460" alt="CALLED FOR THE FEATHER BED" title="" />
<span class="caption">CALLED FOR THE FEATHER BED</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dog's speech made quite a sensation.
Mr. 'Possum, especially, said it was probably
the greatest speech of modern times, and was
going on to say more when Mr. 'Coon whispered
to him that it was their turn on the
program. So then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum
got up, side by side, and Mr. 'Possum
walked rather soggily, because he had eaten
so much, though he managed to get up a little
hickory-tree and out on a smooth, straight
limb while Mr. 'Coon climbed up another, a
few feet away. Then all at once Mr. 'Possum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
dropped and held by his tail, which was
hooked around the limb, and Mr. 'Coon
dropped and held by his hands, and then began
to swing; and pretty soon, when Mr.
'Coon was swung out nearly straight in Mr.
'Possum's direction, he let go and turned over
in the air and caught Mr. 'Possum's hands,
and they both swung, and everybody cheered
and said that was the finest thing yet. Then
they went right on swinging&mdash;Mr. 'Possum
holding by his tail, until they got a good start,
and pretty soon Mr. 'Possum gave Mr.
'Coon a big swing, expecting him to turn clear
over and catch his own limb again. But
Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon had both eaten
a good deal, and Mr. 'Coon didn't get a very
good start. He just missed the limb he was
aimed at, and hit Mr. Fox's feather bed,
which was lying right in front of Mr. and
Mrs. Rabbit, along with other presents, all of
which was a good thing for Mr. 'Coon. For
Mr. 'Coon is pretty smart and quick to
think. He jumped right up when everybody
was laughing, and made a bow to Mr. and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Mrs. Rabbit as if he had meant to land just
that way, and everybody laughed still harder
and enjoyed it more than anything. Then
Mr. 'Possum swung up and caught his limb
with his hands, but couldn't get back on it
again, and called for the feather bed, which
Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Fox brought, and Mr.
'Possum dropped on it like a sack of salt, and
everybody enjoyed it more and more.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/z118.jpg" width="347" height="450" alt="WENT OUT ON THE OPEN TRACK AND TOOK A LITTLE RUN" title="" />
<span class="caption">WENT OUT ON THE OPEN TRACK AND TOOK A LITTLE RUN</span>
</div>

<p>Well, it was Mr. Crow's turn then, and he
said he would probably have to have the
feather bed, too. But he went out on the
open track and took a little run, and about
the second time around spread out his big,
black wings and lifted himself from the
ground, not very high at first, and he had to
flap pretty hard, but he kept getting a little
higher all the time, and presently he swung
about in a big circle, and went sailing and
flapping around and around, up and up, until
he was as high as the little trees, then as high
as the big trees, then as high as a church
steeple, and still kept going up until he looked
small and black against the sky; and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Robin whispered to Mrs. Robin that Mr.
Crow might be old and out of practice, but
<i>they</i> had never dared to fly as high as that,
and said he didn't believe any of Mr. Crow's
family had ever gone higher.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow was just a black speck, pretty
soon, and everybody was getting rather
scared, for they wondered what would happen
to him if something about him should give
way; and just when they were all watching
and keeping quite still, they heard the most
curious sound, that seemed to be coming
nearer, getting louder and louder. At first
nobody spoke, but just listened. Then Mr.
'Possum said something must have happened
to Mr. Crow's machinery and he was coming
down for repairs. And sure enough, they
did see Mr. Crow coming down, about as fast
as he could drive, making quick circles, and
the noise was getting louder and louder,
though it didn't seem to be Mr. Crow who
was making it, for he never could make a
sound like that, no matter what had happened
to his works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Crow came down a good deal faster
than he went up, and in about five seconds
more landed right among them, and they saw
he was scared.</p>

<p>"Oh," he gasped, "we are all lost! The
biggest bird in the world is coming to devour
us! I saw it&mdash;it is making that terrible
noise! It is as big as Mr. Man's house! It
is as big as his yard! It is as big as the Big
Deep Woods!"</p>

<p>And just then a great black shadow, like
the shadow of a cloud, came right over them,
and that noise got so loud it drowned everything,
and when they looked&mdash;for they were
too scared to run&mdash;sure enough, right above
them was the biggest bird in the world&mdash;a
thousand times bigger than Mr. Crow, of
stranger shape than anything they had ever
seen, and very terrible indeed. But all at
once Mr. Dog gave a quick bark, which made
them all jump&mdash;especially the bride&mdash;and
shouted:</p>

<p>"It's all right&mdash;it's all right! I know
what it is. I see a Mr. Man up there. It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a flying-machine; it's only passing over, and
won't hurt us at all!"</p>

<p>And sure enough all the rest could see a
Mr. Man up there, too, then; and Mr. Dog
went on to tell them how he had seen some
pictures of just such a machine in one of Mr.
Man's picture papers, and that it was the
great new invention by which Mr. Man could
go around in the air like a bird, though probably
not so well as Mr. and Mrs. Robin and
Mr. Crow, and certainly with a good deal
more noise.</p>

<p>Then the Deep Woods people were not
afraid any more, and watched the flying-machine
as long as they could see it, and when
it was quite out of sight Mr. Rabbit made a little
speech in which he said that if anything had
been needed to make his grand wedding complete
it was to have a performance given for it
by Mr. Man, even though Mr. Man might not
realize that he was entertaining a wedding.
And everybody said, "Yes, yes, that's so,"
and that this was the greatest day in the Big
Deep Woods, which I believe it really was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they all formed a procession and
marched to Jack Rabbit's house, to take
home the bride and groom. As they marched
they sang the Hollow Tree song, ending with
the chorus:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Then here's to the friends of the Big Deep Woods,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to theirs, wherever they be,</span><br />
And here's to the Hollow, Hollow, Hollow, Hollow, Hollow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here's to the Hollow Tree."</span><br />
